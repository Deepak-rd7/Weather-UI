This is a simple weather application built with React and I used Bootstrap for Styling. It allows users to search for the current weather conditions of any city using the OpenWeather API.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-react-app.git
    cd my-react-app
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

#### Make sure to replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenWeather API key.
